A great set of shortcuts also helps you get done earlier.\r\nSince this project mainly focuses on these constraints it is otherwise very minimalistic.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Enie/Subtitles/gh-pages/images/Subtitles.png)\r\n\r\nThe constraints you can set include:\r\n+ maximum lines per subtitle\r\n+ maximum characters per line\r\n+ maximum characters per second\r\n+ maximum / minimum duration per subtitle\r\n\r\nYou can lock the video's timeline to the subtitles table. On video playback the subtitles table will automatically jump to the current subtitle (in case there is one). When you click on a subtitle in your table while the movie is not playing, the video player will seek to the frame the selected subtitle fades in.\r\n\r\nYou can download the App on www.eniestudio.de ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
